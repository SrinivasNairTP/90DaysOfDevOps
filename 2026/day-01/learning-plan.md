# DevOps Learning Plan

## Objective
Upskill to move into a stronger role at a reputable company by practicing consistently and building practical projects.

## Core skills to learn
- Linux (shell, system administration, networking basics)  
- Automation & CI/CD (scripting, pipeline design, Git/GitOps)  
- Containers & orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)  
- Configuration management (Ansible)

## 3 clear goals
1. Build a production-ready CI/CD pipeline for infrastructure automation (IaC + pipeline + testing + secrets management).  
2. Deploy a real application to Kubernetes (from repo → container → cluster, include rollbacks).  
3. Implement configuration management with Ansible across multiple environments.

## Study plan & commitment
- Weekdays: 2 hours per day  
- Weekends: 4 hours per day  
- Practice daily with consistency and discipline.  
- Track progress with weekly checkpoints and small, deliverable projects.

## Notes
- Focus on hands-on labs and one project at a time.  
- Document what you learn and store configs in version control.
