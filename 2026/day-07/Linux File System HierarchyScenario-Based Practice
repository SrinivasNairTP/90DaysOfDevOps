Linux File System Hierarchy

/ (root) - the statinmh point of everything
when I list the diretories inside root I get the following diretories

ls -al

/bin /user/sbin - Essential and user command binaries (contains user commands such as cat,chmod,chown etc)
/boot - Contains files needed for booting including kernel (contains efi and grub)
/dev - Device files representing hardware
/etc - System-wide configuration files
/home - contains user personal directories
/media & /mount - mount points for temporary/removable media
/opt - Optional or third party packages
/proc - provides real time dynamic info about running processes
/tmp -temporary file often cleared during reboot
/var - variable data files like logs (/var/log) mails and databases 
/user - user related programs,libraries and documentation
/lib & /usr/lib - shared libraries

when run du -sh /var/log/* 2>/dev/null | sort -h | tail -5 the largest file is /var/log/journal which is 50M

when we go /cat/etc/hostname we get to see the hostname

when we run ls -al ~ we get to see all the files and directories including the hidden ones

gives the . and .. → current and parent directory. Parent is owned by root:root (normal).
.bash_history (-rw-------) → command history; only readable by the user (good).
.bashrc, .profile, .bash_logout → shell startup/logout scripts (where environment and aliases are set).
.cache and .config (drwx------) → per-user app caches/configs (restricted access).
.ssh (drwx------) → SSH directory (must be 700). Check inside for authorized_keys, private keys (should be 600).
.sudo_as_admin_successful (size 0) → marker file created after using sudo (harmless).
practice.txt, this → regular user files (sizes and timestamps visible).


[scenario 1] - Service not starting
run systemctl status nginx
ngnix was in stopped state
check for logs in journalctl didnt find any entries
run sudo update and sudo apt install ngnix
after installation checked for ngnix service status using systemctl status ngnix was in start state

[scenario 2] - High CPU usage
check the status using systemctl command
check if service is enabled using systemctl 
start the service if in stopped state using systemctl

[scenario 3] - Application server is slow
check for process consuming high CPU using top and htop
get the pid of process using pgrep
kill the process consuming more memory

[scenario 4] - collect the logs of a sercvice
first check status of the service using systemctl satus <service-name>
Logs of a service can be fetched by journalctl command
journalctl -u <service-name> - 50 view last 50 lines of logs
journalctl -u <service-name> -f view logs in real time

[scenaorio 5] - script at /usr/home/backup.sh is not running
first check permission on the filr backup.sh using ls -l backup.sh command
if there is no X on the file change the file permission using chmod 700 backup.sh 
try to run the file once permission is set it should work
