Devops is all about streamlining the process between development and operations

I want to upskill myself and get places in a good role at a good company 

A good and better position than my current role could offer

I will keep practicing every single day with consistency and discipline

3 core devops skills I would like to learn is Linux,Automation and Building pipelines,kubernetes and Docker

3 clear goals would be develop a CI/CD pipeline which for infrastrucutre automation production ready and deploy an application on kubernetes and configuration management through Ansible

I will allocate myself 2 hours on week-days and 4 hours on weekends
